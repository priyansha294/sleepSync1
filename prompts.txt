Code Prompts (ChatGPT 4o):

1. What elements would a website for SleepSync require? It is a smart pillow that syncs with your sleep cycle and provides personalized lullabies, scents, and posture adjustments.

2. Give me the html + css code chunk for the website with a clean and minimalistic UI. The font could be sans serif and the website should have soft blue tones with interactive buttons when you hover.
    It should have the following sections:
    1. Navigation Bar with the Product Name and logo directing to the other sections in the webpage
    2. Hero Section with the Text overlay over the image of the product mockup. It should have the tagline "Sleep, Perfected." and a CTA (Call-to-action) Button: "Experience SleepSync" or "Pre-Order Now"
    3. Product Features Section :
        Scent Integration – diffuses calming essential oils during sleep
        Soundscape AI – plays personalized lullabies or white noise
        Sleep Tracker Sync – integrates with sleep apps or wearables
        Morning Mode – gentle vibration & natural light alarm simulation
        Each feature should have:
        AI-generated icons or images
        Short, benefit-focused descriptions
    4. Testimonials / Use Cases
        Include quotes from:
        "Busy professionals"
        "Parents"
        "Students"
        "Frequent travelers"
        Use images and names for each customer.
    5. Pricing & Pre-order CTA
        Tiered pricing or one-time early access deal
        Call-to-action button: “Reserve Yours” or “Join the Waitlist”
    6. Contact / Support / FAQ
        Common questions:
        How does it detect my sleep stages?
        Is the scent cartridge refillable?
        How long does the battery last?
    
    Use placeholders for images and also list down the prompts to generate each image.
3. Split the code into different html and css chunks. Can you make the testimonials into a carousal? Also change the Pricing section into a more modern look.
Can you also add an interactive section to get a sleep score? Users can enter their data about sleeping habits and it generates how healthy their sleeping habits are on a scale of 1-10 (10 being the highest. Add a youtube widget as well so i can embed an iframe into it. It can be after the pricing section. 

4. Can you reduce the size of the icons in the features section? They should be smaller and should not exceed outside the card. Also the feature cards should be 2 in one row. Reduce the pictures in the testimonials section as well.
Centre align all the text. Thanks

5. Can you add more questions to the part where we calculate a person's sleep score and then add a CTA button along the lines of "Contact our experts for pillow recommendations".
